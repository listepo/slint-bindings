# Research: embedding Slint in SwiftUI/AppKit and WinUI 3

All sources checked on 2026-10-07 against Slint 1.18.1 unless noted. Facts backed
only by blogs, forum threads or other people's issues are marked **unverified**.

## 1. Official bindings: verdict

**Slint has no official Swift/SwiftUI/AppKit or WinUI/C# integration.**

- Official language APIs in the repository: `api/cpp`, `api/node`, `api/python`,
  `api/rs`, `api/slint-sc`, `api/wasm-interpreter`. No Swift, no .NET.
  ([api/](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/api), master)
- iOS: Rust-only "tech preview" since 1.12, through the winit backend and the Skia
  renderer; whole apps, not views embedded in a Swift app.
  ([iOS guide](https://docs.slint.dev/latest/docs/slint/guide/platforms/mobile/ios/),
  [1.12 release](https://slint.dev/blog/slint-1.12-released)). C++ can target iOS
  since PR [#13580](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/pull/13580) (merged 2026-10-05, unreleased).
- Swift bindings: open **draft** PR [#11167](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/pull/11167)
  "Swift Bridge Implementation" (+8499 lines, community author, label `language-binding`,
  closes issue [#1005](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/issues/1005)). The maintainer asked
  to discuss design first because of its size; not merged as of 2026-10-07. A separate
  community proof of concept: [illucid-matthew/slint-swift-bindings](https://github.com/illucid-matthew/slint-swift-bindings).
- C#/.NET: issue [#4207](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/issues/4207) (label `roadmap`) is
  open; the upstream PR [#3913](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/pull/3913) was closed as
  stale. Third-party alpha: [microhobby/slint-dotnet](https://github.com/microhobby/slint-dotnet)
  (NuGet `SlintDotnet` 1.7.1). Neither embeds into WinUI.
- Embedding into a foreign native window from Rust: no documented API. Discussion
  [#6585](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/discussions/6585) (parent HWND / NSView) has no
  official answer beyond a pointer to a third-party plugin project; issue
  [#4640](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/issues/4640) (the reverse: native window inside
  Slint) is an open RFC.

## 2. What Slint offers for embedding

| Mechanism | Status | Use here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `slint::platform::Platform` + `WindowAdapter` + `set_platform` ([docs](https://docs.rs/slint/1.18.1/slint/platform/index.html)) | Stable | The core: the host owns the loop, forwards `WindowEvent`s, calls `update_timers_and_animations` |
| `SoftwareRenderer` / `MinimalSoftwareWindow` ([docs](https://docs.rs/slint/1.18.1/slint/platform/software_renderer/index.html)) | Stable | M1: render into a host-owned buffer (`PremultipliedRgbaColor` is `repr(C)`) |
| `FemtoVGWGPURenderer::render_to_texture[_view]` ([docs](https://docs.rs/slint/1.18.1/slint/platform/femtovg_renderer/struct.FemtoVGWGPURenderer.html)) | Public in a custom platform; needs `unstable-wgpu-*` types | M3 candidate: render into a wgpu texture we present |
| `unstable-wgpu-29/30`, `BackendSelector::require_wgpu_30`, `Image::try_from(wgpu::Texture)` ([docs](https://docs.rs/slint/1.18.1/slint/wgpu_30/index.html)) | Unstable, versioned by wgpu major | Sharing a wgpu device with the host renderer |
| `raw-window-handle-06`, `Window::window_handle()` ([features](https://docs.rs/slint/1.18.1/slint/docs/cargo_features/index.html)) | Stable feature | Only for Slint-owned windows (winit); not for embedding into ours |
| C++ `slint::platform::SkiaRenderer` + `NativeWindowHandle::from_appkit/from_win32` ([header](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/blob/507b650e/api/cpp/include/slint-platform.h), [example](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/examples/cpp/platform_native)) | Public C++ API | Proof that rendering into a foreign `NSView`/`HWND` works; Rust has no public `SkiaRenderer` equivalent (`i-slint-renderer-skia` is internal) |
| `ComponentContainer` / `ComponentFactory` ([docs](https://snapshots.slint.dev/master/docs/slint/guide/experimental/component-container/), [#2390](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/issues/2390)) | Experimental, Rust only | Slint-in-Slint composition, not native embedding |
| Backends: winit, Qt, linuxkms, android; renderers femtovg, skia, software, experimental vello ([features](https://docs.rs/slint/1.18.1/slint/docs/cargo_features/index.html), [1.18 release](https://slint.dev/blog/slint-1.18-released)) | — | We use none of the backends; we are the backend |

Threading: "the event loop must run in the main thread, in most backends, and all the
components must be created in the same thread" ([crate docs](https://docs.rs/slint/1.18.1/slint/index.html)).
With a custom platform there is no Slint event loop; the host's UI thread plays that role.

Accessibility: the `accessibility` feature exposes the tree to the OS through the
built-in backends ([features](https://docs.rs/slint/1.18.1/slint/docs/cargo_features/index.html));
a custom platform has to provide it itself (plan T14).

## 3. Prior art in this workspace (reuse first)

- `packages/slint_dart`: `slint-dart-core` (thread-affinity guard, FFI event encoding →
  `WindowEvent`), `slint-interpreter-ffi` (software renderer → RGBA frames),
  `slint-skia-ffi` (Skia → Metal texture over an IOSurface `CVPixelBuffer` on Apple, D3D12
  shared texture + NT handle on Windows, EGL elsewhere). Checked at commit `12de634`.
- `packages/slint-flutter`: `native/rust/embedded.rs`, the same host-driven software path
  for Dart/Flutter. Checked at commit `4807387`.
- `apps/weft`: `weft-core`, `weft-catalog`, `weft-swiftui` crates for the Weft milestone.

## 4. Analogous projects

- egui in SwiftUI through wgpu on a `CAMetalLayer`-backed `NSView`, `NSViewRepresentable`,
  swift-bridge, XCFramework: [alex566/swiftui-egui-demo](https://github.com/alex566/swiftui-egui-demo)
  and its article (**unverified** details).
- wgpu Metal surfaces from a layer, and why not to replace an `NSView`'s own layer:
  [wgpu #6107](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/commit/fb0cb1eb11663f8de023f6dd64128ed1f5342ec7),
  [raw-window-metal](https://docs.rs/raw-window-metal/latest/raw_window_metal/).
- wgpu on a WinUI 3 `SwapChainPanel`: `SurfaceTargetUnsafe::SwapChainPanel`
  ([PR #4191](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/4191),
  [surface.rs](https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/src/wgpu/api/surface.rs.html)).
- Godot's proposal for the same WinUI embedding problem:
  [godot-proposals #14848](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/14848) (**unverified**).

## 5. Host facts

### macOS

- Layer-backed `NSView` with CGImage contents is the lowest-risk CPU path; a flipped view
  matches Slint's top-left origin. `NSView.displayLink(target:selector:)` (macOS 14) ticks
  per display refresh.
- GPU path: `CAMetalLayer` (wgpu `CoreAnimationLayer` target) or an IOSurface texture
  rendered by Skia (slint_dart).

### Windows

- WinUI 3 has no supported way to host a child `HWND`; XAML composition draws over it
  ([WindowsAppSDK discussion #3879](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/discussions/3879), **unverified** maintainer-adjacent answer).
- `SwapChainPanel` + `ISwapChainPanelNative::SetSwapChain`, which must be called on the
  panel's UI thread; Microsoft recommends at most four swap chains per app
  ([SetSwapChain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windows.ui.xaml.media.dxinterop/nf-windows-ui-xaml-media-dxinterop-iswapchainpanelnative-setswapchain),
  [SwapChainPanel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.swapchainpanel?view=windows-app-sdk-1.7)).
- Windows App SDK on NuGet: 2.5.1 is the latest stable
  ([NuGet API](https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/microsoft.windowsappsdk/index.json)).

## 6. FFI choices

| Option | For | Against | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hand-written C ABI + cbindgen header | One ABI for Swift (module map) and C# (P/Invoke); no runtime; full control over threading and buffers | Wrappers written by hand per language | **M1–M4** |
| UniFFI ([repo](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs), [Swift guide](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/next/swift/overview.html)) | Generated Swift/Kotlin, C# via third party; already used by cox | Object model and per-call overhead are a poor fit for frame buffers and raw surface pointers; Swift 6 support partial per its docs | Revisit for the typed API (T13) |
| swift-bridge | Idiomatic Swift both ways | Swift only | No |
| Swift C++ interop over Slint's C++ API | Reuses `slint-platform.h`, `SkiaRenderer` | Drags CMake and the C++ SDK into SwiftPM; the community PoC hit `extern "C"` import limits | No |
| csbindgen / generated P/Invoke | Keeps C# in sync with the header | Extra tool | T6 |
