### T1. Scaffold and M1 CPU spike

Rust workspace with `slint-bindings-core` (custom Slint platform, software
renderer into a caller-owned RGBA8 buffer, input, timers, demo form compiled
with `slint-build`) and `slint-bindings-ffi` (`sb_*` C ABI, cbindgen header);
SwiftPM package with `SlintHost`, `SlintNSView` (CGImage layer contents,
`CADisplayLink`, mouse, scroll, keys, focus), `SlintDemoView`
(`NSViewRepresentable`) and a SwiftUI demo app; WinUI 3 skeleton (code only);
`research.md` with sources. `just check` passes on macOS (fmt, clippy, 9 tests,
header drift, `swift build`). The demo window itself was not opened (T2).

### T2. Run and verify the macOS demo

Headless end-to-end tests drive the demo form through the C ABI and through
`SlintHost`: the form paints, ASCII input lands in the name field, Continue and
Enter submit that name, and a repeated resize does not repaint. `SlintNSView`
presents the new frame inside `setFrameSize` and pins it to the top-left, so a
live resize does not stretch the previous image. A non-positive scale is
rejected, a null host is reported through `sb_last_error`, and the WinUI host
publishes a size only after the core accepts it. Replacing the pixel buffer
forces a full repaint; the reused-buffer renderer would otherwise leave the new
storage transparent.

`sb_host_render` at 800×600 pt, 2× (1600×1200), Apple Silicon. The first frame
includes font setup and a full raster; the dirty frame is a later paint after
the name changes. Wall time around the render call:

| Build | First frame | Dirty frame |
| --- | --- | --- |
| debug (what `just swift-run` links) | 14.8 ms | 6.2 ms |
| release | 8.4 ms | 1.0 ms |

The steady frame is under the 8 ms M1 bar in both builds. The demo process
started and stayed up. A captured frame shows the sign-in form at the top-left
of the 2× buffer.

### T3. Vendor slint_dart and share the embedding core

`slint_dart` (https://github.com/listepo/slint_dart) lives in this repo under
`flutter/`. The checkout at `packages/slint_dart` is not modified. Shared
embedding — the process-wide software platform, the Dart FFI event encoding,
and the UI-thread guard — lives in `slint-embed`
(`flutter/packages/slint/rust/embed`). `slint-dart-core` re-exports it, so the
interpreter, the generated AOT glue and Skia keep calling `slint_dart_core::`.
`slint-bindings-core` uses the same platform (reused buffer, host-owned
pixels). The copy's Slint pin matches this repo (`=1.18.1`). Intel macOS
(`x86_64-apple-darwin`) is not a build target.

`just check` passes. `cargo test` for `slint-embed`, `slint-dart-core` and
`slint-interpreter-ffi` passes in `flutter/`.

### T18. Snapshot and screenshot tests

The headless e2e checks that some pixel is opaque. A change to the form can
pass that and still paint the wrong screen. The demo frame is compared to
committed PNG snapshots, and the macOS view's presented image is compared to
the same files.

The caret blinks, so snapshots are the unfocused frame: the idle sign-in form
at 1× and 2×, and the form after the name is set to "Ada".
`SB_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1` rewrites the PNGs when that picture is meant to change.
`just check` passes.

### T6. WinUI host builds and runs (M2)

The WinUI host compiles in CI. Virtual keys, IME composition and the per-RID
DLL are in place. The demo window was not launched (no Windows desktop here).

`VirtualKey` maps to Slint key text in `slint-bindings-core`, one row for every
`slint::platform::Key`, same bar as the AppKit map. Shift+Tab is Backtab, the
two sides of Shift, Control, Alt and the Windows key stay distinct, and
Control names the physical key. The panel sends named keys from `KeyDown` /
`KeyUp` and printable characters from `CharacterReceived`. A rejected Tab or
Backtab moves focus with `FocusManager`.

`CoreTextEditContext` is attached when `GetForCurrentView` succeeds. Its text
store is only the preedit: replacements call `sb_host_ime_*`, which shows the
reading and commits it on `CompositionCompleted`. A cancel drops it. Windows 10
desktop has no CoreWindow, so that call fails and `CharacterReceived` still
inserts text. A headless test commits 日 through the session and inserts a
following character.

`sb_host_render_bgra` writes premultiplied BGRA8, so `SlintHost.RenderBgra` no
longer swizzles. `just windows-dll` (and the ARM64 triple) produces the DLL.
`windows/Directory.Build.targets` copies it beside the app and under
`runtimes/<rid>/native`. `just pinvoke-check` fails if `NativeMethods.cs` and
the header disagree on `sb_*` names. Marshalling stays hand-written.

### T7. GPU path on macOS (M3)

FemtoVG renders on wgpu's Metal backend into a `CAMetalLayer` sublayer of
`SlintNSView`. The view's own layer is not replaced. `sb_demo_new_metal` builds
the host; `sb_host_gpu_render` presents. Live resize sets
`presentsWithTransaction` on the layer. If the adapter or the surface fails,
the view drops the layer and uses the CPU `CGImage` path. CPU and GPU hosts
share `slint-embed`'s platform: `set_next_window` stages the GPU adapter for
one component. The feature is off on Linux. The 4K frame-time checkpoint was
not measured.

### T8. GPU path on Windows (M3)

The same renderer presents into a `SwapChainPanel`. The panel passes
`ISwapChainPanelNative` to `sb_demo_new_swapchain`; wgpu creates the DXGI swap
chain and calls `SetSwapChain` on the UI thread. `CompositionScaleChanged`
resizes it. A failed COM query or adapter keeps the `WriteableBitmap` path.
The window was not launched, and the frame-time checkpoint was not measured.

### T19. Drop Intel macOS leftovers from the Flutter copy

`flutter/` still listed Intel targets after the workspace dropped Intel macOS:
the copied CI installed `x86_64-apple-darwin` for a universal macOS release
build and `x86_64-apple-darwin`/`x86_64-apple-ios` for the Skia job, and
`rustTriple` mapped iOS x64 (a simulator that only runs on Intel Macs) to
`x86_64-apple-ios`. The macOS x64 mapping was already gone.

Plan: remove both Intel targets from `flutter/.github/workflows/ci.yml`, drop
the `(OS.iOS, Architecture.x64)` arm from `cargo_builder.dart`, so an Intel
request fails with the existing `UnsupportedError`. Check with `git grep`
that no `x86_64-apple-*` target remains under `flutter/`.

Result: the CI installs `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`
only; `rustTriple` knows only arm64 Apple targets.
